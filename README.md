## Results
OpenTable has continued to experience growth in global seated diners throughout 2023 and 2024, with increases of 2% to 10% in various markets like the U.S., U.K., and Mexico. In 2024, OpenTable has leveraged AI to maintain its competitive edge. By integrating AI-driven insights, the company has focused on reducing manual processes for restaurants while providing data-driven tools to improve customer loyalty and marketing effectiveness.

>*Our next step is to use AI to consolidate what we’re seeing. If there are 600 reviews, you don’t want to read them all. We can use AI to pull out the sentiment. We can also use it to find the Holy Grail restaurant. Say I’m looking for a restaurant in San Francisco, party of five, seafood, kid-friendly, and my mother-in-law has celiac. Right now, you have to manually filter all of it. That’s something AI can do. It’s our job to make sure we’re surfacing and building those tools*
*- Debby Soo, CEO of OpenTable*

## Conclusion
As technologies and advanced natural language processing evolve, booking experiences will become more intuitive and conversational. 
For example, machine learning algorithms for data analysis will enhance customer retention by providing personalized rewards based on dining habits.

AI and predictive analytics can create a dynamic pricing tool that will allow restaurants to adjust pricing based on demand, maximizing revenue during peak times.

The future of OpenTable is to simplify the process and making it more user-friendly. OpenTable will continue to enhance the dining experience for convenience and ease.

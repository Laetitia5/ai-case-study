## Trends in the World of Online Dinner Reservation
OpenTable began as reservation software and expanded into the world's most comprehensive restaurant platform. The restaurant booking landscape has been revolutionized by innovations such as mobile apps, AI, machine learning, blockchain, and contactless dining solutions. Despite pioneering online dinner reservations, OpenTable faces serious competitors, including Resy, SevenRooms, Yelp Reservations, Eat App, Allset, The Fork, and Toast.
## OpenTable Outcomes
OpenTable's impact has been substantial since its inception in 1998, initially charging $249/month plus $1 per reservation. Competitors like Reserve and Resy only emerged in 2014, offering lower fees. According to E-Commerce 2019 Business Technology and Society, to achieve success, OpenTable shifted its marketing focus to four primary cities and introduced the ERB reservation system. Deploying a sales team to high-end restaurants, it established personalized relationships, driving growth. The initial target markets evolved into active local networks, facilitating nationwide expansion. With over 1.7 billion diners seated, OpenTable's success is attributed to market focus, accessible technology, and strong restaurant relationships.
## Conclusion
The future of online reservation systems is driven by innovation and technology, simplifying booking and managing reservations for customers. For example, integrating apps such as reservation and transportation will enable seamless experiences like automatic cab scheduling with your reservation booking. OpenTable's real-time floorplan updates, from seating to payment, pave the way for these advancements. Customers will add pickup and drop-off locations when booking a reservation. They will receive notifications for scheduled cab pickups and, after paying their check, they will get notified that their cab is on the way. Additionally, OpenTable's expansion into event planning, offering options for venue, food, beverage, and music, presents significant growth opportunities the next years. OpenTable will undoubtedly continue to enhance the dining experience to be more convenient and user-friendly.
